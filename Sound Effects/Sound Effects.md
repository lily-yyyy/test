# Sound Effects
## Introduction
When building COOL game, sound effects is one of he core element. For the our three different types of arcade games, we found the following royalty-free sound effects that can be used.

There are game over music (and potentially loop-able game music), jumping noise (for jump), collision/hit noise, dice roll sound, and some audio saying "start!" and "game over", kick/punch sound, block moving noise.
